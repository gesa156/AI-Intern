Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned text by removing special characters and stop words.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed category distribution and frequent words in spam vs. ham.
Model Training: Used Naive Bayes due to its effectiveness in text classification.
Prediction Function: Classifies new email text as "spam" or "ham."
Evaluation: Compared multiple models, confirmed Naive Bayes as the best performer.

How to Run:
You can directly open it in Colab from GitHub.

Results:
Naive Bayes achieved the best accuracy.
